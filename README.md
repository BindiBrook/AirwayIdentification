# AirwayIdentification
This package performs image analysis on Nanozoom images of paraffin wax embedded lung tissue slices stained with alpha airway smooth muscle actin (SMA) and collagen with picrosirius red (PSR) to quantify airway wall composition. 

Two reference tiffs, obtained via a Hamamatsu Digital Nanozoomer 2.0-HT (Hamamatsu Photonics, UK), one stained with aSMA and the other with PSR, for demonstration purposes are provided here: [reference images](https://uniofnottm-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/bindi_brook_nottingham_ac_uk/EuOFgUVYvxBIh8xa7inOA5UBi31KE9ZD_MYaAKTReBD_Xw?e=5qbqsA)
